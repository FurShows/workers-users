# Contributing via Pull Requests
I encourage contributions in the form of Pull Requests (PRs). Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or improvements to the documentation, your contributions are welcome. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on your changes.

3. **Create a New Branch**: For each set of changes or new feature, create a new branch in your fork.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, bug fixes, or additional features on your branch. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing code style and that you've tested your changes.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Make concise and meaningful commit messages that explain the changes you've made.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository. In your pull request description, provide a detailed explanation of the changes and why they're needed.

7. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make further adjustments based on the review.

8. **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main repository.
